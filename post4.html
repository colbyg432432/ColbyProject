            <h2>Starting The Downswing</h2>
            <p>Initiating the downswing correctly is crucial for a successful golf shot, and Ben Hogan's approach has greatly influenced my technique. Hogan believed that the downswing begins from the ground up, a concept I keep at the forefront of my mind
                as I prepare to transition from the top of my backswing. I start by shifting my weight subtly from my right side to my left, for a right-handed golfer like myself. This shift is more of a lateral move than a turn, as Hogan emphasized the
                importance of not spinning out with the hips. I feel the pressure build in the inside of my left foot, signaling the start of the downswing. Concurrently, my lower body begins to uncoil, led by my left hip moving towards the target. This
                movement is controlled and deliberate, not rushed, as Hogan advised against any jerky motions which can disrupt the swing's rhythm.</p>
            <p>As my lower body initiates the movement, I maintain the wrist hinge from my backswing for as long as possible, a key element in Hogan's technique for generating power. This ‘lag’ creates a whip-like effect in the clubhead, increasing clubhead
                speed. I'm conscious of keeping my upper body and arms relaxed, allowing them to be naturally pulled down by the unwinding of my lower body. Hogan stressed the importance of the arms following the body in a synchronized manner, ensuring
                a smooth, cohesive motion. As I approach the impact zone, I focus on maintaining the alignment of my arms and the club, ready to strike the ball with precision. This disciplined yet fluid approach to the downswing, inspired by Hogan’s
                methodology, has been instrumental in improving my overall swing and shot accuracy.
