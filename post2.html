            <h2>Aligning Towards A Target</h2>
            <p>Aligning to a target in golf is a critical aspect of a successful shot, and following Ben Hogan's teachings, I've found a systematic approach to ensure precision and consistency. Hogan emphasized the importance of alignment, advocating for
                a meticulous setup to ensure accuracy. As I stand behind the ball, I carefully select my target, whether it's a spot on the fairway or a specific part of the green. I visualize a straight line running from the ball to the target, forming
                an imaginary path. This line serves as my guide for aligning not just the clubface but also my body. I approach the ball, placing the clubface first, ensuring it's perpendicular to my target line. This initial step is crucial as it sets
                the direction for my shot.</p>
            <p>Once the clubface is aligned, I position my feet. Hogan suggested that the feet, hips, and shoulders should be parallel to the target line, creating a “railroad track” effect. The idea is that the body lines are parallel left of the target
                line for a right-handed golfer, like train tracks running in the same direction. I pay close attention to this alignment, aware that even a slight deviation can significantly impact the ball's path. I then take a moment to ensure my posture
                is balanced and relaxed, as Hogan believed that proper alignment goes hand in hand with a good stance. By aligning my body correctly, I feel a sense of confidence and clarity, knowing that I've set myself up for the best possible shot,
                just as Hogan would have advised.</p>
