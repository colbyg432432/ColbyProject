            <h2>Drills For Putting</h2>
            <p>Improving my putting has been a key focus in my golf game, and I've found a couple of drills that have really helped sharpen my skills on the green. The first drill I practice regularly is the 'Gate Drill,' which is fantastic for improving
                accuracy. I set up two tees on the ground just wider than the width of my putter head about four feet from the hole. This creates a 'gate' that I must putt the ball through. The goal is to strike the ball well enough to pass it through
                the tees without touching them. This drill has been instrumental in enhancing my stroke path and ensuring my putter face is square at impact. It's a simple setup, but it's incredibly effective at refining my precision and building confidence
                for those tricky short putts.</p>
            <p>Another drill that has been a game-changer for me is the 'Ladder Drill,' which is perfect for developing distance control. I place a series of tees or coins on the green at different distances, creating a 'ladder' pattern away from where I'm
                putting. Starting with the closest marker, I try to putt the ball to just reach each marker without going beyond it. This drill forces me to focus on the pace of my putt, adapting my stroke length and power for each distance. It's challenging,
                especially as the distances increase, but it's greatly improved my feel and touch on longer putts. By regularly incorporating these drills into my practice sessions, I've noticed a significant improvement in my putting performance, making
                me much more confident and consistent on the greens.
