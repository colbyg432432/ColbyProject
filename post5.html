            <h2>How To Chip Around The Greens</h2>
            <p>Chipping around the greens, as taught by Ben Hogan, is an art that requires precision and a soft touch. Hogan emphasized the importance of simplicity and control in the short game. When I approach a chip shot, I remember his advice to use
                a less lofted club for longer chips and a more lofted one for shorter, higher shots. I stand closer to the ball than I would for a full shot, with the ball positioned back in my stance. This position promotes a descending blow, which is
                key for a good chip shot. I narrow my stance, ensuring my feet are only a few inches apart, and I place more weight on my left foot to keep the swing stable and controlled. The grip is slightly down the shaft for better feel and precision.
                Hogan taught that the arms and shoulders should work together in a pendulum-like motion, with minimal wrist action. This technique helps to control the distance and trajectory of the shot.</p>
            <p>In executing the chip, I focus on keeping my wrists firm and allowing my shoulders to dictate the swing. The clubhead moves back and through in a smooth, shallow arc. Hogan advocated for a consistent tempo, regardless of the length of the
                chip. This consistency aids in better distance control and more accurate shots. I keep my head and body still, ensuring that I don't lift up during the shot, which can lead to mishits. The finish is short, with the clubface pointing towards
                the target, mirroring the simplicity of the swing. By following Hogan's principles, I've found that my chipping has become more reliable and effective, allowing me to save strokes around the greens.</p>
