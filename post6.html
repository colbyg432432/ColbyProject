            <h2>Putting Tips</h2>
            <p>Putting, often regarded as the most crucial aspect of golf, is where I focus on precision and a calm mindset. One of the most valuable tips I've learned is the importance of a consistent pre-putt routine. This starts with reading the green,
                where I take my time to assess the slope and grain, understanding how they will affect the ball's path. I visualize the line and pace, imagining the ball rolling along that line into the hole. At address, I ensure my eyes are directly
                over the ball, a key factor for accurate alignment. My stance is comfortable and balanced, with my feet shoulder-width apart. I grip the putter lightly, maintaining a gentle pressure throughout the stroke. This relaxed grip aids in a smoother,
                more controlled putting stroke.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the stroke itself, I focus on keeping my wrists firm and my movements fluid. A pendulum-like motion from the shoulders, rather than the wrists or elbows, is crucial for a consistent stroke. I keep my head still, watching the
                spot where the ball was even after itâ€™s gone, to avoid any unnecessary body movement. The length of my backswing determines the distance of the putt, following the principle of 'longer stroke for longer putts, shorter stroke for shorter
                putts.' The follow-through is as important as the backswing, maintaining the same pace and direction towards the target. This approach helps in achieving not just the right line, but also the correct pace, essential for successful putting.
                By applying these techniques, I find my putting is more consistent, boosting my confidence on the green.
