            <h2>Taking The Backswing</h2>
            <p>As I initiate my backswing, Ben Hogan's teachings echo in my mind, emphasizing the blend of discipline and fluidity. Hogan stressed the importance of starting the backswing with a controlled and smooth takeaway. I focus on keeping my arms
                and shoulders in sync as I start moving the club back. The movement feels like a single, cohesive motion rather than a series of segmented actions. Hogan advised that the hands, arms, and club should move back together, with the wrists
                starting to hinge naturally as the club reaches waist height. This creates the wide arc essential for power. I ensure my left arm remains straight, but not rigid, and the grip pressure consistent, as Hogan often highlighted the role of
                a firm yet relaxed grip throughout the swing.</p>
            <p>As the club continues to rise in the backswing, I'm mindful of Hogan's emphasis on maintaining the original spine angle and avoiding any unnecessary sway. The turning of my shoulders brings the club up, not just the lifting of my arms. Hogan
                described this as a coiling action, with the lower body resisting slightly to build tension and power. My hips turn slightly, but the real rotation comes from my upper body. By the time the club reaches the top of the backswing, my back
                is facing the target, a key Hogan principle. This position sets the stage for a powerful downswing. Following Hogan's guidance, I feel a strong yet controlled tension in my back and legs, poised to unleash the energy in the downswing.</p>
