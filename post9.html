            <h2>Favorite Players</h2>
            <p>Tiger Woods has always been one of my favorite golfers, not just for his incredible skill on the course, but also for his remarkable impact on the game. Watching Tiger play is like witnessing a master at work; his focus, determination, and
                ability to make seemingly impossible shots are awe-inspiring. His career is a testament to what can be achieved through hard work and dedication. I admire how he transformed golf, making it more appealing and accessible to a wider audience.
                His comeback victories, especially his triumph at the 2019 Masters, are a powerful reminder of resilience and perseverance. Tiger's journey, marked by both unparalleled success and significant challenges, resonates with me deeply. It's
                his mental toughness and passion for the game that make him a constant source of inspiration.</p>
            <p>John Daly, on the other hand, is my favorite for entirely different reasons. His 'grip it and rip it' style, flamboyant personality, and unfiltered approach to both golf and life are incredibly refreshing. Daly's game is characterized by raw
                power and a go-for-broke attitude, which makes watching him an exhilarating experience. He's relatable in a way that many professional athletes aren't; his struggles and victories, both on and off the course, feel genuine and human. Daly's
                unconventional approach, coupled with his remarkable talent, has brought a unique flavor to the sport. His two major wins, the 1991 PGA Championship and the 1995 Open Championship, showcased not just his talent but also his ability to
                defy expectations and succeed against the odds. For me, Daly embodies the spirit of golf as a game that's not just about skill, but also about heart, individuality, and enjoying the journey.
